  """Computes TAP-Vid metrics (Jaccard, Pts.

  Within Thresh, Occ.

  Acc.)

  See the TAP-Vid paper for details on the metric computation.  All inputs are
  given in raster coordinates.  The first three arguments should be the direct
  outputs of the reader: the 'query_points', 'occluded', and 'target_points'.
  The paper metrics assume these are scaled relative to 256x256 images.
  pred_occluded and pred_tracks are your algorithm's predictions.

  This function takes a batch of inputs, and computes metrics separately for
  each video.  The metrics for the full benchmark are a simple mean of the
  metrics across the full set of videos.  These numbers are between 0 and 1,
  but the paper multiplies them by 100 to ease reading.

  Args:
     query_points: The query points, an in the format [t, y, x].  Its size is
       [b, n, 3], where b is the batch size and n is the number of queries
     gt_occluded: A boolean array of shape [b, n, t], where t is the number of
       frames.  True indicates that the point is occluded.
     gt_tracks: The target points, of shape [b, n, t, 2].  Each point is in the
       format [x, y]
     pred_occluded: A boolean array of predicted occlusions, in the same format
       as gt_occluded.
     pred_tracks: An array of track predictions from your algorithm, in the same
       format as gt_tracks.
     query_mode: Either 'first' or 'strided', depending on how queries are
       sampled.  If 'first', we assume the prior knowledge that all points
       before the query point are occluded, and these are removed from the
       evaluation.
     get_trackwise_metrics: if True, the metrics will be computed for every
       track (rather than every video, which is the default).  This means
       every output tensor will have an extra axis [batch, num_tracks] rather
       than simply (batch).

  Returns:
      A dict with the following keys:

      occlusion_accuracy: Accuracy at predicting occlusion.
      pts_within_{x} for x in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]: Fraction of points
        predicted to be within the given pixel threshold, ignoring occlusion
        prediction.
      jaccard_{x} for x in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]: Jaccard metric for the given
        threshold
      average_pts_within_thresh: average across pts_within_{x}
      average_jaccard: average across jaccard_{x}
